                    This is an Editor for education resources like questions and other learning materials, here           
            we able to manage education resources as Plain Text, RTF, image, PDF, html and LaTeX.             
            main technology to manage these contents is HTML script, However two usage of Html concept         
            is applyed here, first, as an editor to write learning unit, this type is pure usage of html      
            script to create a learning unit, but it does not support the math formulas. second usage         
            is to save and restore other datatypes in the database.                                           
            We save all of other types in html format indexed by tag of 'meta' and name = 'qrichtext'         
            (the 'meta' is a tag of html). this usage is more integrated with QTextEdit object and            
            QTextDocument. Each script indexed by meta name='viewport' is raw script and is shown to user     
            as pure Html script and other scripts indexted by mata name ='qrichtext' is shown as processed    
            text, These scripts is ready to publish. However, it is possible to edit and it can be edited     
            as normal text(without direct use of HTML or LaTeX codes).                                        
            Supported text datatypes is listed as follow:

            <li><b>Plain Text:</b> is directy written in Text Editor and is converted to html        
                            save time and when is read from database is loaded to the QTextEdit by calling        
                            setHtml(...) method. this method does not support formated texts  and other           
                            special scripts as math formola and image. it is proper to simple resources.
            </li>
            <li><b>Rich Text:</b> Rich Text is a document that is saved by .rtf file extension, like Plain Text         
                            is written directly in QTextEdit an is saved using toHtml() and is restored by        
                            setHtml(...) method. it supports formatted texts, image contents and tables.          
                            Also it able to support other more advanced properies against Plain Text.
            </li>
            <li><b>LaTeX:</b> The LaTeX script is written and saved as plain text. in saveing method of this        
                         content is not used any conversion. It is saved by calling toPlainText() method.      
                         Also at read time from database will been used setPlainText(...). this is row data,   
                         befor using it must be processed by a LaTeX engine like PDFlatex, xelatex and etc.                                                                                  <br>
                         The LaTeX raw script is recognized  at reading time by 'regular expresion processing' 
                         techniques over \documentclass{...}, \begin{document}... \end{document} and other     
                         keywords of LaTeX script.
            </li>
            <li><b>Html:</b> is very similar to LaTeX, we use this script to write Html code directly. LaTex       
                            and Html data are raw and must be processed befor useing. to process the Html code    
                         it is enugh we reset content with setHtml(...). at first step we access to the        
                         Html script of QTextEdit by toPlainText(), next we reset using setHtml(...).
            </li>
            <li><b>Image:</b> Image conent is converted to base64 string at load time and is updated by setting   
                            src="data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}" in img tag, then uses setHtml(...)     
                         method to upload in QTextEdit document. after this step, at save and read time it is  
                         considered as an Html content.
            </li>
            <li><b>PDF:</b> In this code we supose the PDF contents has One page, we don't need more page to use
                         as a learning resource. if the loaded content has been more pages we use first page   
                         and other pages is skipped. If we don't need to manipulation, PDF content can load as 
                         image. becuase of editing porpose, we can load as html raw string. all actions on the 
                         PDF content after load is like image and html.
            </li>
            <li><b>docx:</b> This file type currently is not fully supported. but It can load as  html using
                        'pypandoc' package. currently word documents that loaded by this method loses many    
                         formating properties. however the docx files is loaded as html.
            </li>

            All of data is saved using HTML format with width = 6.19 inches, this value is avilable space for 
            edu-content in the A4 paper, because there are 0.5 inches space for left and right margin and 0.54
            inches is used for columns 1 and 3 in the our 3-columns paper. Below is output table.<br><br>
                                                                                                               
            <img src="../assets/04.png"/><br>
                                                                                                               
             The 6.19 inches must be converted to pixels. this coversion is done by DPI(dots per inches), final
             pixels is equal to 6.19xDPI. to keep quality of images durng conversion, using of 'width=6.19dpi' 
             property of HTML script is good choise against other methods.                                     <br>
             For editable porpose the content is not saved as final version, It is save as raw data. In case   
             of LaTeX script if a content be ready to use or publish, it had been provided by a command 'RUN-TEX'
             this command needs a latex engine to process. After processing it is saved as byte64 image   
             in the html body or tag of img and width=6.19xDPI.
